# What? Another editor?

Yep. Another one... but hear me out.

# Keyframes
We usually use them for animation, but has anybody ever wondered: what if there was more things they could do?

Thats right, this editor is FULL of keyframes. No clips here, they take up space and are very clunky to use. Its a relict of the 1920s back when film was the standard.

What do you really care about in a video editor? REALLY care about? Do you care about the fact that a video exists at every frame from 0 to 3679? Or do you care that a video starts at frame 0, and ends at frame 3679?
This editor lets you put things with the mindset of "i want this here". Gone long are the days of cutting a clip in two points just to add a simple zoom effect. In this editor, just drag the effect to the point in time where you want! Its that simple!

# What exactly IS a keyframe?

It is something that happens at some time.

It can be **anything**... anything you desire (in a video editor, duh).

Whether it be an image, sound, effect, ending,... it is a keyframe.

The **source** dictates what is going to be the _media_ of a keyframe. It can be 
 * image
 * sound
 * video
 * generated media
 * nothing

Basically anything you can imagine.

#

The **action** or rather **actions** are things that the keyframe does to other keyframes. And the action will only have an effect during and after the time it occurs in. And while the keyframe exists, of course.

Actions can 

 * apply effects
 * delete keyframes
 * set states of keyframes

And so on and so forth

#

The **effects** are the spark that lets your video come to life. They take the source, do something with it and give a new source. Effects include:

 * Normal media
 * 3d transform
 * Blurs
 * Borders
 * Any per pixel color operation
 * Warps
 * Custom (shaders)

# But other editors also have this! Whats the point?

Do they have the keyframe system?

Do you use all of the features they offer?

Can you easily make custom effects?

Are they fun?

Can they run on low-end PCs?

Are they free?

Are they easy to use for everyone?

The point is to make an experimental, accessible, free, crazy, open-source, fun video editor for everybody to just use.

It has been started out of nessecity. We do not realize how much our hardware is capable of. Just because it cant run Windows 10, does not mean it cant run a video editor.

If it can run the Source Engine it can run this.

# Is that it?

No.

* Animation presets
   * Make your own style. Anybody can do it!
   * Automatic application of animations
* Special tools
   * Quick subtitling
   * Midi synchronization
   * Easy "crazy error" video making (you know who you are)
* Things you really care about
   * Fisheye warp
   * Chromatic abberation
   * Realistic/stylized shake
   * Chroma key (green screen)
   * Motion blur
* Things you might not care about but are cool nonetheless
   * 3D scene (a little bit more complex than (simpler than you think))
   * .APNG export
   * Pixel perfect rendering (no more chroma subsampling!)
   * .PDN support
   * Realistic message box creation.
   * Transparency from two sources with a black and a white background
