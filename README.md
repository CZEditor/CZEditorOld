# What? Another editor?

Yep. Another one,... but the first one to feature such an exotic way of editing!

# Keyframes
Keyframes. Dont we love keyframes? We usually use them for animation, but has anybody ever wondered: what if there was more things they could do?

Thats right, this editor is FULL of keyframes. No clips here, they take up space and are very clunky to use. Its a relict of the 1920s back when film was the standard.

What do you really care about in a video editor? REALLY care about? Do you care about the fact that a video exists at every frame from 0 to 3679? Or do you care that a video starts at frame 0, and ends at frame 3679?
This editor lets you put things with the mindset of "i want this here". Gone long are the days of cutting a clip in two points just to add a simple zoom effect. In this editor, just drag the effect to the point in time where you want! Its that simple!

# What exactly IS a keyframe?

An event in time. 

Has 3 properties. 

Source, Actions, Effects. 

Here is your boring answer.

Now heres the fun answer:

It can be **anything**... anything you desire (in a video editor, duh).

Whether it be an image, sound, effect, ending,... it is a keyframe.

The **source** dictates what is going to be the _media_ of a keyframe. It can be image, sound, video, generated media, or even nothing!
